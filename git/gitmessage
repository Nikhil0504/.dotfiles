# ===================
# Examples:
#
# feat(photometry): add PSF fitting for crowded fields
# 
# Implement iterative PSF subtraction algorithm for
# dense stellar regions. Uses DAOPHOT-style approach
# with custom background estimation.
# 
# Closes #45
#
# ---
#
# fix(jwst): correct WCS header parsing for NIRCam
#
# The FITS header keywords were incorrectly mapped
# causing 0.1" systematic offset in coordinates.
# 
# Fixes #123
# References: JWST-STScI-001234

#
# data(calib): update flat field corrections
#
# New flat fields from proposal 2345 show improved
# correction in detector corners. Applied to all
# F200W observations.
#
# ---
#
# science(spectro): improve continuum fitting algorithm
#
# Replace linear fitting with spline interpolation
# for better handling of emission line regions.
# Reduces RMS by ~15% in continuum-normalized spectra.
#
# ---
#
# docs(api): add docstrings for coordinate functions
#
# Complete API documentation for all coordinate
# transformation utilities in coords module.
